It was one thing when we were all stuck in traffic together, but now I feel like I'm getting a big \"fuck you\" from the local government because I don't want to shell out 5 bucks just to go to Broward and back. Isn't that what the Turnpike is for? If the net ever goes that way Wayne Brady is gonna have to choke a bitch.  ",

However, the way they are implemented; taking up existing lanes and further constricting regular \"non express traffic\" is highly inefficient and downright stupid.
